# Aurora Junkies

It can be difficult to find a great spot to take photos of the Northern Lights. With Aurora Junkies you can meetup with like-minded photographers and find the best locations to take photos of the dancing lights together. 

Photographers can add locations and photos from some of their favourite spots. They can chat with each other before they meet up to plan, or afterwards to talk about how much they enjoyed themselves!

Users can set up their profile page with 3 of their favourite photos and the camera settings they useed to take them.

Since you're heading into the remote locations away from light pollution, it's important to be safe as well. Aurora Junkies will send a message to a safety contact's phone in order to keep them up-to-date on your plans.

We hope everyone enjoys using the site to connect with like-minded photographers and finding the perfect spot to get that awesome aurora photo!

## Running the site

You need **THREE** terminal windows/tabs for this (or some other plan for running two Node processes).

In one terminal, `cd` into `react-front-end`. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies. Then run `npm run start` or `yarn start`, and go to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

In the second terminal, `cd` into `express-back-end`. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies, then `npm run start` or `yarn start` to launch the server.

In the third terminal, stay in 'express-back-end'. Run 'npm run chat' or 'yarn chat' to launch the chat server.
